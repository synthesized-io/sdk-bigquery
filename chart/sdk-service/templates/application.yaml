      # Open your web server

      Flower API and UI are exposed by the ClusterIP-only service `{{ .Release.Name }}-flower-service`. To connect to the
      Flower Webserver, you can either expose a public service endpoint, or keep it private, but connect
      from your local environment with `kubectl port-forward`.

      ## Forward the Webserver port in your local environment

      To use `kubectl`'s port forwarding feature to forward port to your local
      machine, run the following command in the background:

      ```shell
      kubectl port-forward \
        --namespace {{ .Release.Namespace }} \
        svc/{{ .Release.Name }}-flower-service \
        5555:555
      ```

      Now you can access the Flower UI with [http://localhost:5555](http://localhost:5555).
