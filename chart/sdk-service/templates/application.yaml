      Synthesized Scientific Data Kit (SDK) is a comprehensive framework for generative modelling for structured data (tabular, time-series and event-based data). The SDK helps you create compliant statistical-preserving data snapshots for BI/Analytics and ML/AI applications. Right-size your data with AI-supported data transformations.
      This delivery contains the SDK bundled up with a Jupyter notebook. This provides an easy platform to start working with synthetic data.

      # Open your web server

      SDK Notebook is exposed by the ClusterIP-only service `{{ .Release.Name }}-service`. To connect to the
      SDK Webserver, you can either expose a public service endpoint, or keep it private, but connect
      from your local environment with `kubectl port-forward`.

      ## Forward the Webserver port in your local environment

      To use `kubectl`'s port forwarding feature to forward port to your local
      machine, run the following command in the background:

      ```shell
      kubectl port-forward \
        --namespace {{ .Release.Namespace }} \
        svc/{{ .Release.Name }}-service \
        8888:8888
      ```

      Now you can access the Webserver with [http://localhost:8888](http://localhost:8888).
