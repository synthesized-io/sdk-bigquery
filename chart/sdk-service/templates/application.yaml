      # Open your web server

      Flower API and UI are exposed by the ClusterIP-only service `{{ .Release.Name }}-flower-service`. To connect to the
      Flower Webserver, you can either expose a public service endpoint, or keep it private, but connect
      from your local environment with `kubectl port-forward`.

      To get the external IP address of your Flower Web Server, use the following

      ```shell
      SERVICE_IP="$(kubectl get "service/{{ .Release.Name }}-flower-service" \
      --namespace {{ .Release.Namespace }} \
      --output jsonpath='{.status.loadBalancer.ingress[0].ip}')"
      echo "http://${SERVICE_IP}/"
      ```
